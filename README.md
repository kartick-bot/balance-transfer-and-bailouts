# balance-transfer-and-bailouts
This technique was proposed for rebalancing link weights in decentralized credit networks.

# Description
Credit networks are peer-to-peer trust-based networks that enable fast and
inexpensive cross-currency transactions compared to traditional
bank wire transfers. Although researchers have studied security
of transactions and privacy of users of such networks, and
have invested significant efforts into designing efficient routing
algorithms for credit networks, comparatively little work has
been done in the area of replenishing credit links of users in
the network. This is achieved by a process called rebalancing
that enables a poorly funded user to create incoming as well as
outgoing credit links. We propose a system where a user with
zero or no link weights can create incoming links with existing,
trusted users in the network, in a procedure we call balance
transfer, followed by creating outgoing links to existing or new
users that would like to join the network, a process we call
bailout. Both these processes together constitute our proposed
rebalancing mechanism.
